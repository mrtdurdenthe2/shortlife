## Effect Best Practices

**Before implementing Effect features**, run `effect-solutions list` and read the relevant guide.

Topics include: services and layers, data modeling, error handling, configuration, testing, HTTP clients, CLIs, observability, and project structure.

**Effect Source Reference:** `~/.local/share/effect-solutions/effect`
Search here for real implementations when docs aren't enough.


## Local Effect Source

The Effect repository is cloned to `~/code/opensource/effect` for reference. 
Use this to explore APIs, find usage examples, and understand implementation 
details when the documentation isn't enough.
